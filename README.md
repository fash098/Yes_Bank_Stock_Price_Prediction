Yes Bank Stock Price Prediction - Classification Project


This project aims to tackle the intricate challenge of predicting the closing stock price of Yes Bank, a pivotal concern for investors, stakeholders, and market participants. Being a significant private sector bank in India, Yes Bank has faced notable obstacles lately, encompassing a considerable volume of non-performing loans and involvement in fraudulent activities. These disturbances triggered regulatory interventions by the Reserve Bank of India, intensifying the complexity and unpredictability of forecasting Yes Bank's stock prices.
