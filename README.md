Yes Bank Stock Price Prediction - Regression Project


This project aims to tackle the intricate challenge of predicting the closing stock price of Yes Bank, a pivotal concern for investors, stakeholders, and market participants. Being a significant private sector bank in India, Yes Bank has faced notable obstacles lately, encompassing a considerable volume of non-performing loans and involvement in fraudulent activities. These disturbances triggered regulatory interventions by the Reserve Bank of India, intensifying the complexity and unpredictability of forecasting Yes Bank's stock prices.

To address this, the project employs an extensive dataset spanning monthly stock price records since the bank's inception. This dataset encompasses crucial metrics like monthly closing, opening, highest, and lowest prices. The primary aim is to construct predictive models proficient in capturing the intricate trends and dynamics within Yes Bank's stock prices, while accounting for the turbulent events and uncertainties linked to the bank's performance.

A successful forecast of Yes Bank's closing stock price holds the potential to furnish valuable insights, facilitating judicious investment decisions for stakeholders.
